              Worked within an agile team of 5 people to build a full-stack
              application for the School of Code in 4 weeks. The platform aims
              to strengthen the community after the course through event
              organisation, while allowing coaches to gauge the wider impact of
              the course. We utilised tools such as Jira to plan and work in
              short sprints, as well as Balsamiq and Adobe XD, to build
              wireframe and hi-fidelity designs. I focused primarily on
              front-end implementation using React, as well as the front-end
              design and user experience. We implemented external modules
              including Nodemailer to integrate event reminders and updates, and
              the Google Maps API for event locations.

              During a two day hackathon, my teammate and I started planning
              thinking of an interesting and fun game to play. We came up with
              the concept of Shooty Mc Beard Face and begun. We first made a
              detailed plan of what classes we will have, what states they will
              contain and what their behaviours will be. We then started coding
              and iterating over the plan in an agile fashion. We faced some
              issues such as creating a computer player for the user to play
              against and it was solved changing the position of the computer
              player randomly then writing out some logic regarding what would
              happen when the bullets touch either player or the obstacles in
              the map. We used Math.max to limit the playerâ€™s health and also
              gave the player the capability to move around the map using x and
              y positions in the Canvas and also to shoot with the left mouse
              button. We finished our MVP within the time frame given to us.

            <p>
              Scheduling and organisation is a core part of our lives so I
              designed the app to seem like it is a living entity to represent
              that concept. When you hover over the buttons, they animate in and
              out as if they are breathing. When a user creates a todo, counter
              or note, they are encrypted using cryptoJs AES and then sent to
              the backend where they are encrypted again before being sent to
              the database. The reason I did this was just to give users peace
              of mind that their data is being handles securely even though it
              is not very necessary since the app runs on https which anyways
              encrypts data. That being said, privacy nowadays is a very
              important factor so practice in this field is always good.

              with just a couple clicks. I also pre-installed some extensions
              like ad-block and picture-in-picture to make it more attractive to

              We used opentdb's trivia api and received 3 incorrect answers in
              one array and 1 correct in another from the api. We then took to
              placing them in one array and assigning them to li tags so users
              can interact with them but also wrote a function which shuffles
              location of the correct/incorrect answers as to make them appear
              in a different choice option every time. The game also informs the
              player of the correct/incorrect answer when they make their
              choice. It's a fun and competitive game that was done with a heart
              full of passion and little time.

              This project was done in a group of 5 over a span of 4 days. We
              were tasked with creating a platform were mentors and mentees can
              visit, submit a form and get matched with one another based on
              specific criterion. The criterion include the skills the mentee
              wants to inherit for their future plans and also a myers Briggs
              personality type. Essentially we wanted mentors and mentees to
              have compatible personality types after reading a scientific
              article that this way the learning is enhanced.
